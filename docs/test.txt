questions:
	- did we decide to leave scoring in self-assessments?
	- Prev should be Back to Draft?
	- 8A.14: Can we remove the report from the Reports section? Would require a lot of rework to make it work for Seattle, but we did that
	  through adding it to the Summary page
	- where is the download all button?
	- did I get the new observation session title right? "Untitled: 2013-2014.1"
	- lock/unlock session process
	- if the pr just sets portions of the observation as visible, is the report sub-section visible?
	- on unlock does session go back to not visible?
	- 19.6: what about when it is focused (through the Instructional Framework it will have to show all D# panels where Focus rubric
          components fall.
	- 19.9: observation information report
	- da,dv roles request from BSD
	- EOY extract: GetUsersInRoleInDistrictBuilders(SESchoolTeacher): missing anyone?
	- BRD 6.4: Should we put "teacher" in the extract report name so if we support principals in the future we can distinguish them?
	- BRD 8A.5: If the report has not yet been submitted, the evaluator can move it back to previous phases, including back to Draft: Can only go back to draft?
	- do we need some descriptive text about the difference between observation information and report?
	- observation information printed by: where should it go?

todo:
	- evaluatee sessions settings for lock
	- add 'report generated by eVAL' on observation information report


tests:

	- test with Focused and Comprehensive eval
	- test the carry forward of nextyear eval plan, reporttitle
	- update WfState to submitted when non-seattle submits
	- principal submission wf
	- non-seattle submissioni wf
	- readonly settings throughout


later:
	- add goals to zip
	- evaluatee archive
	- LINK_TO_VIDEO enum value position
