Classroom Observation Report Template.dotx - can only be a resource document

Collaborative Goal Setting Template.dotx - can only be a resource document

Formal Observation Summary Template.dotx - this looks like the rubric document, but it is quite a condensed version of the one that was entered for them from the tpep website.

Planning Conference Interview Protocol Template.dotx - looks like a standard set of pre conference questions; likely would go in the pre-conference question bank

Reflection Conference Summary.dotx - these would be pre-conference questions?

Summary of Evaluation Cycle Activities and Evidence.dotx - this would map to the pre-conference planning and observation events.  The summary of evidence portion would map to artifacts.  However, we only align the artifacts to the 8 state criteria... is this going to be a problem for Nthurston?

Summative Evaluation Template.dotx - NT seems to offer this as an overall performance measure... an end of the year summary of how a teacher is rated... where would this go in acuere? 

Teacher Lesson Reflection Template.dotx - more reflective questions.  Is this part of the planning for an observation?

Is there a principal rubric doc?
